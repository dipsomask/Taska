# Taska - Voice assistant for computer

This is a voice assistant, so far limited to the computer, I have decided not to go into phone applications yet. 
Performs basic functions that will be refined by itself.

# (Pre)Version - 0.1
Includes functions:
  ~ search in the net
  ~ time explanation
  ~ explanation of her capabilities
  ~ I announced a music playback block in the configs, but I never started doing it
  
  The version work on background process and runs in the console. 
# In the next versions
  I want to make graphical interface
  or bring her at least to some decent appearance and add some more functional.
